    <p>Both the ACT and SAT are difficult tests. The easiest way to start studying for them is to take a practice test of each. PDF versions can be found all over the internet for free. While most students will focus on one of the tests, sometimes students will take both. Switching tests can improve scores as they are very similar. The list below provides the differences between the two.</p>
